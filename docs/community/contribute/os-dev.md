# We’re Looking for OS Developers — Build Linux-Based Systems 🐧

We're assembling a team of passionate **operating system developers** to create custom **Linux-based distributions** and full-featured desktop operating systems.

If you have experience with **C++**, understand **how Linux works under the hood**, or are eager to build your own system from scratch — this is your chance to make a real impact.

## 🔍 Who We’re Looking For

We're looking for developers with experience or interest in:

- Building **custom Linux distributions** (from LFS, Gentoo, Debian, Arch, etc.)
- Developing **init systems**, **system services**, **daemons**, or **core utilities**
- Creating and maintaining **Linux drivers** and **kernel modules**
- Writing **C/C++** code for system components, utilities, and performance-critical tasks
- Developing graphical environments using **Qt** (Wayland compositors, window managers, panels, etc.)
- Designing **bootloaders**, **system installers**, and **recovery tools**

---

## 💡 Skills That Matter

- Solid understanding of **Linux internals** (init, systemd, kernel, userspace)
- Experience compiling and configuring the **Linux kernel**
- Familiarity with **Bash**, **Makefiles**, **CMake**, **pkg-config**
- Working knowledge of **Wayland**, **X11**, **DRM**, or **KMS**
- UI/UX experience with **Qt Widgets** or **Qt Quick (QML)**
- Familiarity with **system packaging** (Deb, RPM, custom formats)

## 🧠 Ideal Candidates

You might be a great fit if you’ve ever:

- Built your own Linux system manually (LFS or similar)
- Written or patched a kernel driver
- Created your own system service or init replacement
- Developed or themed a Qt-based desktop environment
- Contributed to open-source system tools or utilities
